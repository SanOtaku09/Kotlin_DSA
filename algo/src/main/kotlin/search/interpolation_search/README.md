# About

interpolation search uses a mathematical formula
to get the index near the key value or the key value

we generate approximate index of key value from array
and check if it's right
if approx index's value is greate than key than
we move index to high else index value to low
and keep reating whole process

# limitation

    1. only applicable for int array
    2. requires array to be shorted

# time complexity

O(log2(log2 n))

# space complexity

O(N)
