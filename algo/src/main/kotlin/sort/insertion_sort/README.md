# About

insertion sort is a in place sorting algorithm

it select element one by one in increasing order
of their index and keep placing them in their 
right posistion.
where element on it left if any is smaller 
and element on the right if any is greater than 
selected number.

# best time complexity
O(N)

# worst time complexity
O( N ^ 2 ) 

if the array is in decending order

# space complexity
O(1)
doesn't requires extra space
