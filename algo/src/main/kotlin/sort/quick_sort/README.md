# About

quick sort is a divide and conqueror algorithm
for sorting an array

we choose an element out of array as pivot and it
can be anyone but it is best to choose middle for best
time complexity
than we divide the array into three new array first array
contains lower value than pivot other contains higer value
than pivot and last one contains equal value.
we does this recursively and when reached base case ( array size == 1 )
we start joining all array and we get a sorted array

# time complexity

O( N log N )

# space complexity

O( N )
